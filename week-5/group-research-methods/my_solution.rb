def my_array_sorting_method(source)
  source.sort_by {|x| x.to_s}
   # This line is here to make sure all tests initially fail. Delete it when you begin coding.
end

def my_hash_sorting_method(source)
   new_hash = source.sort_by { |x,y| y}
end

# Identify and describe the Ruby method(s) you implemented.
# I used the sort_by method here in my refactored solution. The sort_by method works by taking an input (a hash or an array), and then uses the parameters to determine what to use as a sorting method. 
# In my array example, I used a variable x to stand for each item in the array (this is the part inside the || symbols). The second part, outside of the symbols, tells the method what to use to sort. When I tried to run it, I got an error because the method couldn't compare numbers and strings. When I added x.to_s (which converts each item to a string) to the code block, it was able to successfuly order the array based on the strings. While this worked here, it would need to be refactored if there were larger numbers in the array. When comparing the numbers as strings, for example, it would order like it would alphabetically (so 35 would come before 4).
# My original solution covered this by creating two separate empty arrays, pushing numbers to one and strings to another (using the is_a? method), then sorted each individually and then combined them. This would work for an overall example, but is much wordier.
# In the hash example, I did something very similar. Since a hash has both a key and a value, I need to put |x,y| within the code block. The x here represents the key and the y represents the values. Since I wanted to order by the age (the values), I had it sort by the y.

def my_array_deletion_method!(source, thing_to_delete)
  source.each do |x| # do to each element of the array
    if x.to_s.include?(thing_to_delete) #converts element to string, if the element includes the item to delete then,
      source.delete(x) #deletes element with the specified thing
    else
      nil #if not included then move on
    end
  end
      source #returns the updated source(array)
end

def my_hash_deletion_method!(source, thing_to_delete)
  if source.include?(thing_to_delete) #if the source includes the thing(key) to delete then,
    source.delete(thing_to_delete) #deletes item specified
    source #returns the updated source(hash)
  else
    puts "#{thing_to_delete} not found" # returns string if the key was not found in the hash
  end
end

# Identify and describe the Ruby method(s) you implemented.
#.include? evaluates "thing_to_delete" with each value in both hash and array and sees if the value is there or not
#.to_s sets ever element to a string
#.delete removes the element from the hash or array

#
# It seems like partition is awesome and easily usable based for both
# hashes and arrays (it is an enumerable method). In the block, you
# specify what your criteria are; partition returns an array of all
# elements where the criteria are true followed by all where the
# criteria are false. So for instance:

# arr = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7]
# arr.partition { |x| x < 4 } => [[1,2,3],[4,5,6,7]]

# Release 3: Reflect!
# What did you learn about researching and explaining your research to others?
#1. Identify and describe the Ruby method you implemented
# => #select: Declare an item that represents an object, and a block of code to apply to that item.  Objects that return true in that block will be returned.
# => to_s: turn object into a string
# => include?: checks to see if the object in question includes what is in the following parenthesis
# => each do: declares each key and value as items and applies a block of code to them individually
#2. Teach your accountability group how to use the methods
# => select's syntax is object.select{|item| block}
# => to_s: use this to turn an object such as an integer to a string. 15.to_s == "15"
# => include?'s syntax is object.include?(item)
# => each do's syntax with hashes is object.each do |key, value| and will iterate over each pair
#3. Share any tricks you used to find and decipher the Ruby Docs
# => I feel like the Ruby Docs are pretty clear about what goes where.
# => They name their variables clearly and give simple examples of what each method produces.
