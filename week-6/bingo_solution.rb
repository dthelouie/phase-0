# A Nested Array to Model a Bingo Board SOLO CHALLENGE

# I spent [#] hours on this challenge.


# Release 0: Pseudocode
# Outline:

# Create a method to generate a letter ( b, i, n, g, o) and a number (1-100)
  # CREATE set up random generator for ("b", "i", "n", "g", "o") and (1-00)
  # ASSIGN letter and number to variables
  # INTERPOLATE two strings to create called space

# Check the called column for the number called.
  # ASSIGN each letter to corresponding array

# If the number is in the column, replace with an 'x'
  # IF array include? number, get index key
  # ASSIGN indexed value to 'x'

# Display a column to the console
  # p index of column

# Display the board to the console (prettily)
  # ITERATE over each element in @bingo_board
  # p each nested array

# Initial Solution

class BingoBoard

  def initialize(board)
    @bingo_board = board
  end

  def call
    @letter = ["B", "I", "N", "G", "O"].sample
    @number = rand(1..100)
    puts "Does anyone have #{@letter}#{@number}?"
    puts

#Reflection
# 1. How difficult was pseudocoding this challenge? What do you think of your pseudocoding style?
# => I didn't think it was very difficult, I think it helped in breaking each step into even
# => smaller steps so each process doesn't get mixed in with the flow of anohter.
# 2. What are the benefits of using a class for this challenge?
# => With a class, you're able to use instance variables across methods.  This was a huge
# => help because of the way we have to use information in each of our processes.
# => Without instance variables, we wouldn't have the number or letter being called, and we
# => wouldn't have access to the board's values.
# 3. How can you access coordinates in a nested array?
# => With nested arrays, you have to index multiple times, so it's clear which nested array, and
# => what element within that array you're trying to access.
# => You could also assign each of the nested arrays to variables, and then index those
# => variables individually.
# 4. What methods did you use to access and modify the array?
# => I used the method "include?" to check if the array contained the number that I was looking for
# => and "index" to give me the index number of the element that was equal to the number that was called.
# => I modified the element by reassigning the indexed position's value.
# 5. Give an example of a new method you learned while reviewing the Ruby docs. Based on what you see in the docs, what purpose does it serve, and how is it called?
# => As I just mentioned, I used the method "index" for the first time.  When applied to an array,
# => you give it a value to look for, and if the value exists in the array.  If the value exists,
# => the method returns the element's index position.
# 6. How did you determine what should be an instance variable versus a local variable?
# => If I knew I was going to need a variable in another method, such as I did with @letter
# => and @number, I made it an instance variable.  If I knew I was only going to use the variable
# => locally, I left it as a local variable, like I did with column.
# 7. What do you feel is most improved in your refactored solution?
# => Deciding to put my letters into a hash that was assigned to numbers that would be used
# => for indexing was probably the biggest improvement in my refactoring.  It replaced the whole
# => if/elsif statement that I had in place to figure out which column I was looking at.
