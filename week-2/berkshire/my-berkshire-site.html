       		1. What was it like to translate your previous learning with HTML into an actual site?

			It was really interesting to see how all of this writing and formatting translates into something like what we see online every day.

		2. How was it researching and using semantic HTML5 elements?

			Researching and using the HTML5 elemnts was pretty simple.  Most everything that we didn't know already was found within one Google search.

		3. How did you do at keeping to best practices (i.e. no formatting in the HTML)

			We kept everything as simple as possible since we'll be adding the formatting in the coming weeks.

		4. What seems good and bad about HTML?

			HTML seems like it's really good for making websites with easy ways to insert images and links, but from what I've learned so far, it seems pretty barebones.  This impression will probably change when I learn more.

		5. What tricks do you have for remembering how to write HTML?

			I have a cheatsheet in my notes, but I try to remember them as plain words.  Things like "img src" being image source, or thinking of them as sentences.
