2. What is your site's primary goal or purpose? What kind of content will your site feature?

	This website will be mainly for professional purposes, so it will feature my work history, accomplishments, background, and a link to my blog

What is your target audience's interests and how do you see your site addressing them?

	My target audience includes potential employers who will be interested in my skillset and how well I may or may not fit with their companies.  I plan to have more than enough information on my website to present myself clearly and efficiently.

What is the primary "action" the user should take when coming to your site? Do you want them to search for information, contact you, or see your portfolio? It's ok to have several actions at once, or different actions for different kinds of visitors.

	The primary action that I want my users to take would be to look through my portfolio, and then contact me.

What are the main things someone should know about design and user experience?

In design, you always want to think about the end-user and what their needs are.  Is the website easy and pleasant enough for them to use?  Is it going to make them want to come back? A good user experience should always be a top priority.

User experience design is about making sure your website appeals to your user on multiple levels.  If you want to make a user into a returning user, you want them to feel like their experience on your website met all their needs and more.  

Which parts of the challenge did you find tedious?

I found the making of a site map to be tedious, but I see how useful it can be.  The main reason why I thought it was tedious was because I don't feel like I have a lot to put on there right now, but with more time in DBC, I know that will change.
