			<p>
			Welcome to HTML Anatomy 101. In this class, you will do the
learn how to dissect an HTML page from the &lt;head&gt; to the &lt;footer&gt;, add a new feature to Sublime Text, and mark up your previous blog posts with semantic HTML tags. So get your gloves on, open your textbook (the HTML docs (Links to an external site.)) and begin!

				<h3>Release 0: Set up</h3>
			</header>
			<p>
			Decide who will drive and who will navigate.  Then each of you will need to:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Create a feature branch in the phase-0 directory</li>
				<li>Using the command line, navigate to the week-3 directory</li>
				<li>Within that directory, (using the command line) create a blank HTML page called dissect-me.html.</li>
				<li>Add, commit, and push your changes to GitHub. Create a quick pull request and merge the changes. </li>
				<li>SUBMIT your link to the dissect-me.html file as soon as you do this. This is how your guide will give you feedback. The URL should be something like: https://github.com/[USERNAME]/phase-0/blob/master/week-3/dissect-me.html (Links to an external site.)</li>
			</ul>

				<p>
					NOTE: You should decide whether to trade roles in each release or change roles halfway through the session. If you decide to switch from release to release, you'll want to share code easily using a collaborative editor (or even a simple Google doc).

<!--
1. What HTML5 tags have you used in this challenge and continue to return to often? Why?

	I used section more in this session because I learned more about what it's for.  Release 4 mentioned that the semantic tags were released to lessen the reliance of the div tag.  I used them to separate the sections of the body into more easily identifiable pieces.

2. How do elements get laid out on a page? What is the order the browser uses to display elements?

	The browser reads the html document line by line so that it sees that your tags are all closed and nested correctly.

3. What did you learn about Sublime in this challenge? Do you think you'll create more handy snippets at a later date? What about research some shortcuts that already exist?

	I learned about Sublime snippets and how useful they can be.  I might make snippets for tags that create opening and closing tags.  That way I can be sure about opening, closing, and nesting them correctly.  I'll be sure to look up what shortcuts already exist so that I can be more efficient in my work while I use Sublime.
